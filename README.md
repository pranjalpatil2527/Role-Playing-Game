Fight between good(Wizard) and evil(Orc) characters to win the game
Engage in an epic battle between a mighty wizard and relentless demons! Click the "Attack" button to initiate the fight. The wizard begins with a robust health pool of 60, while the demons each have 30 health.

The wizard rolls three dice initially, and the sum of the dice is subtracted from the demon's health in the first round. However, the demons have their chance for revenge with three rounds of attacks: one die in the first round, two dice in the second, and three dice in the third.

Both sides have a fighting chance, but only one will emerge victorious in this thrilling showdown!
